Setting Shorewall

The program will not start unless you change the shorewall configuration file /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf .You can do this in following way:
nano /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf

Change the first line from

STARTUP_ENABLED=No
to
STARTUP_ENABLED=Yes

Save and Exit
#################################
Turning on Forwarding

Finally we get to the last necessary file, /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf. This file manages global shorewall options, and you should read it through completely.
nano -w /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf

We need to find the section of the file that talks about "IP_FORWARDING" and change it from "Off" to "On". If you don't, your packets won't be able to get from one interface to the other.
IP_FORWARDING=On

Save and Exit
